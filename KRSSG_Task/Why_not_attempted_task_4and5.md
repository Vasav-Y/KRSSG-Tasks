Actually I really wanted to attempt task 4 and 5 they were much easier in comparison of the task 3 as in them we had to read documentation and implement the code accordingly but I faced a lot of installation errors I treid many times to install these because I wanted to attempt these tasks they were very interesting but everytime I resolved an error a new error came and a lot of time got wasted in this and also there was presssure of midsem 
And at last I was disheartened that I want to attemp the tasks but I can't beacause of these installtions errors


Sorry :(
